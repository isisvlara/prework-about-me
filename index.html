      <h1>Introduction</h1>
      <p>Hello and welcome to a brief bio of mysself.</p>
      <h1>Where I'm From</h1>
      <p>I am originally from San Pedro Sula, Honduras.</p>
      <h1>What are your favorite hobbies?</h1>
      <p>
        So, I am a collector of hobbies. <br />
        They range from stilt walking and balloon twisting to reading and
        drawing.
        <br />
        I have dogs that I enjoy going on hikes with. I like hosting gatherings
        and I also own about 80 different species of plants.
      </p>
      <h1>What's your dream job?</h1>
      <p>
        I would love to be a video game developer but... being retired sounds
        good too.
      </p>
      <h1>Where do you live?</h1>
      <p>
        On a good day, I live 15 minutes away from Seattle. <br />
        However, when you include traffic, it is about 40-50 minutes away.
      </p>
      <h1>Why do you want to be a web developer?</h1>
      <p>
        I want a career where I can be creative and yet grounded at the same
        time.
